<h1>Rolce Roys - The best Car</h1>
Rolls-Royceâ€™s automobile and airplane divisions were spun off from one other in the early 1970s and now have separate owners. The two companies still share the same name, though, along with the same hunger for excellence. Just look at the electric plane the non-carmaking Rolls-Royce announced a couple years back. The battery-powered aircraft recently hit a top speed of 387 mph in testing, making it not just the fastest electric plane but the fastest electric vehicle, period.<hr>
